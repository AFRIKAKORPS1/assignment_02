# Assignment 2

## Learning Goals

1. Edit a file using a text editor or IDE
1. Run tests locally, i.e. on your own computer
1. Commit and push changes from your local computer to your repository
1. Fix a series of tests that focus on 
  * strings
  * None
1. Write a separate python file (`.py`) containing logic to be tested


## To get started
1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your
   solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn
   in the assignment.

## Completing the Assignment

Last week you used the Github editor.  This week please use the editor of
your choice to make alterations to the code.  This requires that you clone
the repository to your computer.

After you have made changes, please check your code using `nosetests`.  See 
the readings for how to do this.  Once your tests are passing locally, commit
the changes, push them to your repository, and submit a pull request.

If you are having trouble gettings tests to pass post in the blackboard
discussion area and/or submit a pull request with failing tests so that
I can take a look and offer assistance.  You can always update an open
PR by making another commit.
